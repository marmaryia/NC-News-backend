For the purposes of running the code, two files need to be created locally:

- .env.test, setting PGDATABASE value to nc_news_test (for connection to the test database when running the code in the test environment);
- .env.development, setting PGDATABASE value to nc_news (for connection to the development database when running the code in the development environment).
